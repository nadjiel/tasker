# Tasker - Task List API

## 📆 About
Tasker is an in progress API that is being developed for the practice of the Spring Boot technology.

This project was created following the steps of an online course that was available on the [Rocket Seat](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/) plataform.
The course was taught by the teacher Daniele Leão.

After the course, I plan on making some implementations by myself for perfecting the project.

Currently it is decided that the API is gonna have 2 routes: one for the user and one for the tasks, so its gonna be pretty straight forward.

## 👇 Accessing
If you wanna access the API, you must download the repository and run the project in your machine, since the project is not deployed online.
